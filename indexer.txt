Here's how you can build a vector space model (VSM) using tf-idf from an inverted index list file:1. Loading the Inverted Index:Open the inverted index file.This file likely contains information for each word, typically including:The word itself.A list of document IDs where the word appears.Optionally, the frequency (count) of the word in each document.2. Building Vocabulary and Document List:Create a dictionary to store the vocabulary (unique words).Iterate through the inverted index:For each word encountered:Add the word to the vocabulary dictionary (if not already present).Keep track of all unique document IDs encountered (can be stored in a separate set).3. Initializing the Term-Document Matrix:Create a matrix with dimensions (vocabulary_size, number_of_documents).This matrix will hold the tf-idf weights for each term (word) in each document.You can initialize all values in the matrix to 0.4. Calculating tf-idf for Each Word-Document Pair:Iterate through each word in the vocabulary:For each document in the document list:Check if the inverted index contains information for this word in this document.If information is present:Calculate the term frequency (tf):This could be retrieved directly from the inverted index if stored.Otherwise, you can count the number of times the word appears in the document list associated with the word in the inverted index.Calculate the document frequency (df):This is the number of documents where the word appears. You can determine this by iterating through the document lists for all words in the inverted index and counting how many times the current document ID appears.Calculate the tf-idf weight using the chosen formula (likely with the provided normalization for tf). A common formula is:tf-idf = (1 + log(tf)) * log(N / df)N: Total number of documents in the collection.Update the corresponding cell in the term-document matrix with the calculated tf-idf weight.5. Building the VSM:Once you've processed all word-document pairs, the term-document matrix holds the tf-idf weights for each term in each document.This matrix, along with the vocabulary and document list, represents the VSM.Additional Considerations:Remember to handle cases where a word doesn't appear in a document (tf = 0, but avoid division by zero in tf-idf calculation).You might choose a different tf normalization technique or explore smoothing methods for idf.This is a basic implementation. Libraries like scikit-learn in Python offer functions for building VSMs with tf-idf weighting.Remember: This code will depend on the specific format of your inverted index file. You'll need to adjust the code to match how the information is stored in your file.
